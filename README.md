# CS305

The client was Artemis Financial, a caompany that handles funds and creates financial plans for customers.
The main need of Artemis Financial was the need for a secure system due to the fact that they handle sensitive information.
I was new to the concept of finding vulnerabilities so I don't believe I did anything particularly well.
It is important to code security, especially when you are handling personal and sensitive information.
It is vital to keep the clients as well as the company safe from cyber attacks, because a leak of personal information can ruin lives.
Vulnerability assessment was rather difficult all around to understand for me. There were point where I was very confused as to why certain things were a vulnerability.
I increased security by suggesting the switch to HTTPS for all communications as well as implementing two factor authentication.
Finally updating all the dependencies was a big part of helping keep the company secure.
I ran the same test over again on refactored code to ensure that there was no new vulnerabilities and if there were, I would promptly fix them.
I spent a lot of time googling a lot of examples as well as rereading a lot of the lesson multiple times. 
The concept makes sense, but I am someone that needs more practice to fully feel comfortable, so with time and practice, I will be more confident.
I would show future employers the use of the tests to find vulnerabilities in an efficient and fast way.
